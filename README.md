## Why

I needed to pretty print some sensitive json from the the logs, so could not use web sites like
[jsonprettyprint.com](http://jsonprettyprint.com/)
or
[jsonprettyprint.net](http://jsonprettyprint.net/).  (Plus, these tools break if you paste an invalid json).

Also, this is a test bed for 
[FxEditor](https://github.com/andy-goryachev/FxEditor),
a super-fast text editor that can work with very large texts.
