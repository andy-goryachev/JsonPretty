# JsonPretty

JSON/XML pretty printer that won't leak your data.

## Why

I needed to pretty print some sensitive JSON and XML from the logs, so web sites like
[jsonprettyprint.com](http://jsonprettyprint.com/)
or
[jsonprettyprint.net](http://jsonprettyprint.net/) were out of question.  In addition, many tools fail to parse a malformed or invalid
JSON or XML, something that happens often when one copies from a log.

Also, this is a test bed for 
[FxEditor](https://github.com/andy-goryachev/FxEditor),
a super-fast text editor that works with very large texts.
